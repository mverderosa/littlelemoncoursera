Hi guys, this is my project. If you want to view it on your VSCode follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder in your VSCode;
2. Copy the project in Github by clicking to "Code" in my repository;
3. Open the terminal of the folder you've created and write "git clone" and the copied link;
4. Lastly, add the node_modules by writing "npm install"
