# Little Lemon

## Project Description
This is my final project for Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course.<br/>
The project is made entirely with React, CSS and HTML. This also features utilizing API calls.

NOTE: every button takes you to a page, however the only page with some content in it is the Reservation page.

## How to see it:

1. Create a new folder in your VSCode;
2. Copy the project in Github by clicking to "Code" in my repository;
3. Open the terminal of the folder you've created and write "git clone" and the copied link;
4. Lastly, add the node_modules by writing "npm install"
